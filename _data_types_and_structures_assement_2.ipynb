        "Strings in Python are immutable, which means once a string object is created, its contents (the sequence of characters) cannot be changed.\n",
        "If you try to modify a string, Python actually creates a new string object instead of altering the original one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heres why Python enforces immutability for strings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency (String Interning)\n",
        "\n",
        "Python often reuses string objects (called interning) to save memory.\n",
        "Example: all occurrences of \"hello\" in your code may point to the same memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "If strings were mutable, changing one \"hello\" would unintentionally change all other references to it, causing bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Hashability (Dictionary & Set Keys)\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings are commonly used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionary keys must be hashable, and immutability ensures that the string’s hash value does not change over its lifetime.\n",
        "If strings were mutable, their hash could change, breaking dictionary lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "Since strings often represent important data (filenames, URLs, messages, etc.), immutability ensures they cannot be accidentally altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes programs safer and more predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Thread-Safety\n",
        "\n",
        "In multithreaded environments, immutable objects are safer since multiple threads can share them without worrying about one thread modifying the value while another is reading it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example Demonstration:\n",
        "s = \"hello\"\n",
        "print(id(s))   # memory address of original string\n",
        "\n",
        "s = s + \" world\"   # creates a new string, doesn't modify the old one\n",
